# 1.1 Homework 1

I keep some data frames in CSV format accessible from my website. One of them is called `personality.csv` and has, as you might imagine, personality variables. In this case, we will compare the narcissism levels based upon the grouping variable of biological sex.

x = 5
y = 10
x+y

The `nan` value indicates there is no value for that cell in the table. In this case, it's a survey item that went unanswered. The `numpy` function `nanmean` takes the average but ignores any `nan` values. In a clean table, we could just use `np.mean`, instead.
